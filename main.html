          I was born in a tiny town, or as we call it, an asphaulted village,
        in the middle of nowhere in Russia. 17 years later I moved to Madison, Wisconsin to attend
        the university. I started studying Biology but quickly got bored and moved to Physics, where
        I was introduced to the fun of programming. Now I live in Seattle learning front-end
        development and applying for jobs. Fun beans!
